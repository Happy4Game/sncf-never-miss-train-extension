# SNCF Never miss your train

![alt text](example.png)

SNCF Never miss your train is a browser extension for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge designed to prevent users when train it is canceled.

It allows users to view real-time departure and arrival schedules for SNCF train stations and, most importantly (in future), proactively sends notifications if a specific train is delayed or cancelled.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Live Station Boards: Instantly view real-time departures and arrivals for any SNCF station (like in a train station).

- Cancellation Alerts (in the future): Set up monitoring for your specific train. The extension runs in the background and notifies you immediately if the train is marked as "Supprimé" (Cancelled) or significantly delayed.

## 📦 Installation

Download the source code or clone this repository.

Open your browser and navigate to chrome://extensions or edge://extensions.

## 🛠️ How it Works
